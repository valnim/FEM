Excercise 2a):
A convergence criterion of 1e-100 can not converge because the floating point accuraccy is 1e-16.
Therefore to converge a number like 1e-15 can be used.

Excercise 2b):
a)
For a criterion of 1e-3 convergence is reached after 3 iterations.
The horizontal displacement of the top right corner is -3.03533

b)
For a criterion of 1e-13 convergence is reached after 5 iterations.
The horizontal displacement of the top right corner is -3.03533

As the solutions are the same an convergence criterion of 1e-3 is sufficient.

Excercise 3):
a) 2x2
For a criterion of 1e-10 convergence is reached after 5 iterations.
The horizontal displacement of the top right corner is -3.03533

b) 10x10
For a criterion of 1e-10 convergence is reached after 6 iterations.
The horizontal displacement of the top right corner is -3.10274

The accuracy for 2x2 is not as good as for 10x10 but requires far less computation.
Generally an increase in elements results in better accuracy than an decrease of the convergence criterion.
