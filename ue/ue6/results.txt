1) Time Steps
Increasing and decreasing the amount of timesteps resultet in the same solution.
The reason for that could be that because the problem is not very dependent on nonlinearties, 
as the deformations are generally in normal direction.

2) Pressure Value
Increasing the pressure results in a less uniform deformation across the pressure boundary.
Reducing the pressure results in a very uniform deformation mostly normal to the boundary edge.
