• Model:
Model inherits of Nodecontainer and consists of Elements, Faces, Boundaries, Nodes, Edges, a Material and Types.

• Shape:
Defines the standard Elements used in the calculation in FEM. (Real Elements are Transformed to standard Elements)

• RealIntegrationPoint:
Integration Point class for the real element.

• NaturalIntegrationPoint:
Integration Points for the standard elements.

• Type:
Defines the following propoerties of an Nodecontainer:
- Number
- Shape Order
- Shape Type
- Number of Int Points

• Jacobian:
Contains the methods for calculation of the jacobian,
inversejacobian and determinantes of the jacobian of an element,
used in the fem calculation.

• Implementation:
Contains the methods for calculation of the stiffness matrix,
the integration of volume loads (for Elements) and integration of surface loads (for Faces)

• DOF:
Contains methods for retrieving and setting the constraints of a node.
Also used for reading and setting of the displacement of a node.

• Analysis:
Handles the whole fem calculation:
- Integration of Boundary Conditions
- Assembly of the Global Stiffness Matrix
- Calculation of the Displacement of the Nodes
- Writing the Solution using the OutputHandler
